# 🔄 Repository Restructure - Migration Notice

## What Changed

The repository has been reorganized to focus on the **unified dashboard** as the primary application:

### ✅ **New Structure**
- `dashboard.py` - **Main application** (was `unified_dashboard.py`)
- `legacy_solar/` - **Legacy files** moved here for reference
- Updated documentation to reflect dashboard focus

### 📁 **Files Moved**
The following files have been moved to `legacy_solar/`:
- `solar_dashboard.py` (original standalone solar dashboard)
- `weather_integration.py` 
- `debug_*.py` (development debugging scripts)
- `UNIFIED_DASHBOARD_*.md` (development documentation)

## 🚀 **Migration Steps**

### If You Were Using `unified_dashboard.py`:
```bash
# Old command
python unified_dashboard.py

# New command  
python dashboard.py
```

### If You Were Using `solar_dashboard.py`:
The standalone solar dashboard has been **fully integrated** into the main dashboard. 

**Use the new unified dashboard instead:**
```bash
python dashboard.py
```

All solar functionality is available at **http://localhost:5000/solar**

## ✨ **Benefits of New Structure**

### 🎯 **Focused Purpose**
